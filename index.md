# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about Rabbit Hole.  
The entrance is this small gaping hole that leads on a seemingly endless trail that has no end. There is also a phrase that is associated
with it, called 'Going Down the Rabbit Hole'. In reference to "Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland", the main character Alice curiously chases 
after a well-dressed rabbit with a giant watch into a rabbit hole in order to appease her curiosity, leading to a series of adventures that 
are described in the book.
